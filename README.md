# Chamorro_Dictionary_Project

Basic code for searching the Chamorro Dictionary. It won't run without the dictionary files, which aren't yet publically available.

I also doesn't include the reg-ex based stripper. It does have some basic helper functions including a function lcs_sw that returns the longest common subsequence and the smallest window containing it.
